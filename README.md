# Swirl Craft

Welcome! Swirl Craft is a C++ template library for
efficient, real-time fluid simulation.

## Getting Started

Swirl Craft is a header only library, with no external
dependencies, the only requirement is that C++17 or later
is used. To use Swirl Craft, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grotball/SwirlCraft.git
```

Then add the created directory to the include path (or move the subfolder 
SwirlCraft to your project). And finally, add 
`#include <SwirlCraft/swirl_craft.h>` in your project to start using Swirl Craft 🎉.

Swirl Craft is currently in a highly experimental stage, and has no
documentation, but have fun anyway 😁.
